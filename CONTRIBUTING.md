# Contributing to API-FOOTBALL R Package Project

## Introduction

We warmly welcome contributions to the API-FOOTBALL R Package project. This document outlines our workflow and responsibilities to help you get started with contributing to our project. Our team, comprising three members, collaborates on developing wrapper functions, handling testing, maintaining documentation, and managing code integration.

## How to Contribute

Contributions can be made in various forms, such as new features, bug fixes, documentation improvements, etc. Below are the guidelines on how to contribute effectively to our project.

### Development of Wrapper Functions

- **Task**: Contribute by developing wrapper functions for the API-FOOTBALL API. Each team member typically takes up the development of three functions.
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensure the robustness and efficiency of your functions.

### Testing and Exception Handling

- **Test Cases**: Write comprehensive test cases for your functions.
- **Exception Handling**: Implement proper exception handling for resilience.
- **Continuous Integration**: Integrate tests and exception handling strategies into the `.yaml` file for CI.

### Personal Workbook Updates

- **Documentation**: Keep personal workbooks updated with progress and insights for transparency and effective project tracking.

### Collaborative Package Development

- **R Package**: Contribute to assembling the R package, including R scripts, the vignette, CI configurations, and documentation.
- **Platform Integration**: Prepare the package for deployment on GitHub or other platforms.

### Code Management and Review

- **Branch Management**: Work on your own branch; avoid direct commits to the main branch.
- **Code Reviews**: Participate in code reviews before merging any branch into the main branch for quality assurance.

### Package Validation

- **Testing**: Ensure the R package runs successfully in your development environment.
- **Cross-Verification**: Engage in cross-verification of work to catch potential issues early.

## Workflow

1. **Initialization**: Start by creating individual branches from the main branch.
2. **Development and Testing**: Develop wrapper functions, write test cases, and handle exceptions.
3. **Documentation**: Keep documentation of progress and insights updated.
4. **Integration**: Integrate code and tests into the CI pipeline.
5. **Review and Merge**: Review code with team members before merging into the main branch.
6. **Package Assembly**: Collaborate on assembling the R package.
7. **Final Testing**: Conduct final testing before deployment.

## Reporting Issues

Please report any bugs or issues you find in the [issues section](link_to_issues_section_of_your_repo) of our GitHub repository.

## Conclusion

Your contributions are crucial to the success of this project. We appreciate your efforts in development, testing, documentation, and review to create a robust and efficient R package for the API-FOOTBALL API.
